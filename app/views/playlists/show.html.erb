<h2>"Music is the soundtrack of your life" - Dick Clark</h2>
<p>There are a ton of ways to find your last words or create something meaningful to you or your beloved family and friends.
Sometimes music helps to say a lot more - to remember certain moments, get a bit emotional, to laugh, to cry or to just dance.
Determine what you want them to remember thinking of you. Create the soundtrack of your life in Spotify and connect your playlist.
This can be shared with your friends and family after your funeral to remember you the way you want. But also think about the funeral itself.
Music means a lot to you and is an important part of everyones' funeral. List the songs you wish to be played during your ceremony. </p>
