<h2>What are your wishes and preferences regarding your digital after life? </h2>
<p>Apparantly once we are gone we are not fully gone. Contracts, data and liabilities stay as they are when no one looks after them. That can potentially cause problems for those who inherit or they miss out on wealth you may not have thought of. We would like to give you a couple of examples and make you think of the accounts, contracts, bonus cards etc. you have and your loved ones should take care of. </p>
